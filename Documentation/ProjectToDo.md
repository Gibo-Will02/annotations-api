If you have any questions in regards to this project or it's code contact me at nsternecker@gmail.com.
I will try to get back to you as soon as I can.

[1] Finish adding data passthrough from client side and the database 

[2] Establish database on K-State servers 

[3] Establish a Data Cache for a Cron job to update the database during the very late hours or very early hours think 11:30pm â€“ 2:00 am 

[4] Add a way to add data to the database 

[5] Combine the navbar and router 

[6] Filter data so that teachers can only see their own classes they are an instructor of and not other instructors classes. 

[7] Add ability to give researchers a special permission to exclude the data filter based on instructor id. (maybe a separate whitelist? Or a way to mark specific users) 

[8] add dyanmic charts and other data displays to help simplify data

And most importantly Keep your specification document updated and your project's README.md is correct.
